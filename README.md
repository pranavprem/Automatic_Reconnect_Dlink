# auto_dlink_router
Dumb script to automate reconnecting to the internet on Dlink routers that disconnect on an erratic connection.


# Prerequisite
Chrome/Firefox
TamperMonkey/GreaseMonkey

# Steps
1. Add the scripts in this repository to GreaseMonkey/TamperMonkey. Make changes to the script accordingly. These were made for TamperMonkey. Change the namespace for GreaseMonkey.
2. Go to the url for your router. For dlink, by default, 192.168.0.1
3. Magic?
